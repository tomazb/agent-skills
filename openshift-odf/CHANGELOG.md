# Changelog

## 1.0.0

- Initial release of the OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF) lifecycle skill.
- Covers discovery, OLM-based install, Local Storage Operator disk preparation, ceph-rbd block, cephfs filesystem, MCG/NooBaa and RGW object storage, capacity expand/shrink, upgrade, backup/restore/DR, maintenance, uninstall, validation, hardening, and troubleshooting.
- Emphasizes ODF best practices: OLM `Subscription` install in `openshift-storage`, driving all changes through the `StorageCluster` CR, and never hand-editing the ODF-owned Rook CRs.
